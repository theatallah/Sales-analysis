# Sales-analysis
Sales analysis using files from https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/ , and their youtube channel https://youtu.be/TK0CJBaqvnY 

Basically there is excel file for sales data years 2014-2017, dimensions tables consisting of product categories and sku, states and order priority

So first you need to import these files into power query and clean them slightly if you want, this what i did, i added some fields into calendar table like year, monthname, month etc

Then you can use either power bi or power pivot to create your visuals
